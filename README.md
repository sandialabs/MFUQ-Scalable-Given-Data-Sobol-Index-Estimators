# Practical extensions to given-data Sobol' index estimators

This repository contains the source code to replicate the results for analytical test functions presented in [1].

Results are generated in Jupyter notebooks, which import relevant code capabilities from associated Python files.

An implementation of the original all-at-once main-effect index algorithm is provided in `empirical_sobol.py`
